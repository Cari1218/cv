    <p><em>Teacher turned coder</em></p>
    <p>I was an educator for about eight years.I taught English and Reading courses to middle schoolers, and ended with my last year teahching first grade.
         I recently decided to give up my title as educator to pursue a carrer in computer Science. It was always something that interested me, and I couldn't
         be more excited to learn.</p>
